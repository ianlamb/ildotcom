	"p1Body": "This began as a revamp of my old portfolio / personal website and a way to play with some new technologies. After some time working with angular and node I wanted to continue building stuff, so I started designing out the rest of the site. Most of it was to track and display my personal accomplishments but it was also a big learning experience for me.",

	"p2Body": "I will continue to update and improve this website and essentially use it as a sandbox for trying new technologies. This is my showcase to anyone that looks me up on the internet, so I'll be trying my best to keep it tip-top.",
