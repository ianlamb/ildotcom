##### This is my personal website that covers the basics of a "web developer portfolio" and goes beyond to demonstrate fully dynamic content and really just give more insight into the kind of person I am outside of work. Hopefully this repo exhibits everything I stand for in web development and can be used by others as a reference/learning tool.
